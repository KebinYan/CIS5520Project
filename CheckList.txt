Q:
1. Use of multiple threads in the program on GUI, and main flow of the program.
2. !! to retrieve elements given that index is valid, a more efficient DS for matrix?
3. head given that the container is not empty
4. deductions for project complexity, is it complex enough?
5. More efficient way of providing hints other than simulation algorithm


Ideas:
1. Provide hints  
    - figure out the best algorithm to provide hints 
    - design how to integrate hints action into the game
    - implement hints
2. Score calculation
    - score accumulation approach
    - score display
    - score ranking or history
    - best score for each level
3. Player profile
    - player name
    - player level
    - player score
    - player history
    - player ranking
4. Game progress resumption
    - save game progress
    - load game progress
    - delete game progress
5. GUI 
    - learn to use an advanced GUI library
    - design a better GUI
    - design a more user-friendly GUI
    - design a more interactive GUI
TODO:
1. Chain special effect candy (currently, trigger one would replace all candies within range)
2. Termination condition and display of game over
3. Shuffle candies when no more valid moves
