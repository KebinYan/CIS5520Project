// Description: This file defines the candies and their effects in the game.
// Users can define their own candies and effects by modifying this file.
// Each candy must have a predefined effect. Users need to define the effect before assigning it to a candy.
// 
// Effect Definition:
// - `effect_name`: The name of the effect.
// - `effect_range`: The range of the effect.
// - `effect_requirement`: The number of candies required to trigger the effect. 
//    - Effects with the same requirement may randomly trigger if matched simultaneously.
//    - Supports comparison operators [`>`, `>=`, `=`] (default is `=`).
// - `effect_description`: A textual explanation of the effect.
//
// Range Definitions:
// There are 4 types of effect ranges:
// 
// # Circle
// Parameters: `radius`
// Effect Range: Includes all positions `(dx, dy)` where `dx² + dy² <= radius²`, relative to `(x, y)`.
// Example: For `radius = 2`, the effect range includes `(0,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)`.
//
// # Rectangle
// Parameters: `width`, `height`
// Effect Range:
// - If `width = 1`: Includes all positions in the current row. Equivalent to `Arbitrary [(0, :)]`.
// - If `width` is even: Expands equally to both sides but includes one extra row upward.
// - If `width` is odd: Expands symmetrically above and below the current row.
// - Same logic applies to `height` in the vertical direction. (Even height includes one extra column to the left.)
// Example: For `width = 3, height = 2`, the range includes rows `[x-1, x]` and columns `[y-1, y, y+1]`.
//
// # Diamond
// Parameters: `radius`
// Effect Range: Includes all positions `(dx, dy)` where `|dx| + |dy| <= radius`, forming a diamond shape centered at `(x, y)`.
// Example: For `radius = 2`, the range includes `(0,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (2,0), (-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2)`.
//
// # Arbitrary
// Parameters: List of offsets
// Effect Range: Takes a predefined list of relative offsets `(dx, dy)`.
// - `x > 0`: Downward, e.g., `(1, 0)` means the cell below.
// - `x < 0`: Upward, e.g., `(-1, 0)` means the cell above.
// - `y > 0`: Rightward, e.g., `(0, 1)` means the cell to the right.
// - `y < 0`: Leftward, e.g., `(0, -1)` means the cell to the left.
// - `x = :`: Includes all positions in the current row.
// - `y = :`: Includes all positions in the current column.
// Example: `[(0, :), (:, 0)]` represents an entire row and column crossing `(x, y)`.
