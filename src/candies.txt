// Description: This file defines the candies and their effects in the game.
// User should be able to define their own candies and effects by modifying this file.
// User needs to define the shape of the candy, the effect of the candy, and the range of the effect.
// The shape of the candy is defined by the shape_name and shape_icon.
// The effect of the candy is defined by the effect_name, effect_range, and effect_description.
// Define effect_range: all range values are coordinate offests relative to the generated candy position.
// For example, if the current candy is at (x,y)
// effect_range = [(0,:), (0, :)] // the first is x's range, the second is y's range. 
// effect_range = [(-1,1), (-1,1)] // the first is x's range, the second is y's range. This means 9 coordinates [(x-1,y-1),.., (x+1,y+1)] will be affected.
